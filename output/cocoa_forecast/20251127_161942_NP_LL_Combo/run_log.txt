--- (1/3) Tuning bandwidth for PRE-BREAK model ---
Creating bandwidth grid with T=5300, d=2
Generated bandwidth grid: [0.023949   0.03994934 0.06663951 0.1111614  0.1854284  0.30931321
 0.51596553 0.86068238 1.43570474 2.39489984]
Set block size to 1060 for training length 5300 and Q=4.
Best bandwidth for PRE-BREAK model: 2.3949

--- (2/3) Tuning bandwidth for POST model ---
Creating bandwidth grid with T=1372, d=2
Generated bandwidth grid: [0.02999906 0.05004145 0.08347417 0.1392433  0.23227183 0.38745276
 0.64631016 1.07811032 1.79839641 2.99990601]
Set block size to 274 for training length 1372 and Q=4.
Best bandwidth for POST model: 0.0835

--- (3/3) Tuning gamma for Convex Combination model ---
Best gamma: 0.00 (MFV MSE: 0.001574). A value near 0 gives more weight to the post-break model.
