 0.51539982 0.85973872 1.43413062 2.39227405]
Set block size to 1067 for training length 5335 and Q=4.
Best bandwidth for PRE-BREAK model: 2.3923

--- (2/3) Tuning bandwidth for POST model ---
Creating bandwidth grid with T=1337, d=2
Generated bandwidth grid: [0.03012854 0.05025744 0.08383445 0.1398443  0.23327435 0.38912507
 0.64909974 1.08276362 1.80615857 3.01285408]
Set block size to 267 for training length 1337 and Q=4.
Best bandwidth for POST model: 0.0838

--- (3/3) Tuning gamma for Convex Combination model ---
Set block size to 267 for training length 1337 and Q=4.
Best gamma: 0.00 (MFV MSE: 0.002991), while being close to 1 means more weight on the full model.
